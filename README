WELCOME
=======

Welcome to Resize !

Resize is a free, secure, portable, extendable, high-performance
executable packer for several executable formats.


INTRODUCTION
============

Resize is an advanced executable file compressor based on UPX technology. 
Resize will typically reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 
50%-70%, thus reducing disk space, network load times, download times and
other distribution and storage costs.

Programs and libraries compressed by Resize are completely self-contained
and run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most
of the supported formats.

Resize supports a number of different executable formats, including
Windows programs and DLLs, Linux executables, and macOS binaries.

Resize is free software distributed under the term of the GNU General
Public License. Full source code is available.

Resize may be distributed and used freely, even with commercial applications.
See the Resize License Agreements for details.


SECURITY CONTEXT
================

IMPORTANT NOTE: Resize inherits the security context of any files it handles.

This means that packing, unpacking, or even testing or listing a file requires
the same security considerations as actually executing the file.

Use Resize on trusted files only!


SHORT DOCUMENTATION
===================

'resize program.exe' will compress a program or DLL. For best compression
results try 'resize --best program.exe' or 'resize --brute program.exe'.

Please see the file README.md for the full documentation. The files
NEWS and BUGS also contain various tidbits of information.


THE FUTURE
==========

  - Stay up-to-date with ongoing OS and executable format changes

  - RISC-V 64 for Linux

  - ARM64 for Windows (help wanted)

  - We will *NOT* add any sort of protection and/or encryption.
    This only gives people a false feeling of security because
    all "protectors" can be broken by definition.

  - Fix all remaining bugs - please report any issues
